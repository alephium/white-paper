We propose a novel sharding algorithm that supports cross-shard transactions natively without using locks or other synchronization mechanisms.
With our new technology, transactions could be committed in parallel to the network achieving >10K TPS with low transactions fees.

We decompose smart contract into token protocol and data protocol to enable developers to build scalable blockchain applications easily.
The operational aspect of the token could be automated using a dedicated scripting language.
